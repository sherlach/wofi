## drun and dbus
Some desktop files declare themselves as being launched by dbus, if this is the case wofi can experience issues on systems where a user session bus is not automatically started such as systems using elogind.

To manually launch a user session bus run the following:

	dbus-daemon --session --address=unix:path=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus
